However, commercially available sensors usually exhibit non-linear and cross-reactive behavior, contrary to the idealizing assumptions about linear and perfectly molecule type-specific sensing often made in the MC literature. To address this gap, we propose a detector for molecule mixture communication with a general non-linear, cross-reactive receiver (RX) array that performs approximate maximum likelihood detection on the sensor outputs.
