We evaluate our detector and alphabet design algorithm through simulations that are based on measurements reported for two commercial MOS sensors. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed detector achieves similar symbol error rates as data-driven methods without requiring large numbers of training samples and that the alphabet design algorithm outperforms methods that do not account for the RX characteristics.
